## How to play

Use the arrow keys to slide all blocks on the 4-by-4 grid left, right, up, or down. If two of the same blocks slide into each other, they will multiply. With each click, a new block is randomly generated in an empty location on the grid. 

Play until you reach 6561! You lose if the grid becomes full and no more valid moves can be made. 

## Features

The game keeps track of your best score in each session.
